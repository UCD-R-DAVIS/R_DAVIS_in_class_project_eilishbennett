# Above, removing variables in the environment that were from the Week2 Videos. 

# Code below copied from homework. Question: how did this code generate so many values and variables? Where does it all come from? 
set.seed(15)
hw2 <- runif(50, 4, 50)
hw2 <- replace(hw2, c(4,12,22,27), NA)
hw2

# Instruction: Take your hw2 vector and removed all the NAs then select all the numbers between 14 and 38 inclusive, call this vector prob1.
na.omit(hw2)
hw2

#Question: I used a different code for this, the example uses a function with an exclamation point. How does that function work?
prob1 <- na.omit(hw2)
prob1 <- prob1[prob1 >= 14 & prob1 <= 38]
prob1

# Instruction: Multiply each number in the prob1 vector by 3 to create a new vector called times3. Then add 10 to each number in your times3 vector to create a new vector called plus10.
times3 <- (prob1)*3
times3

plus10 <- (times3)+10
plus10

# Instruction: Select every other number in your plus10 vector by selecting the first number, not the second, the third, not the fourth, etc. If youâ€™ve worked through these three problems in order, you should now have a vector that is 12 numbers long that looks exactly like this one:
final <- plus10[c(TRUE,FALSE)]
final
